### Deskripsi Data dan DBMS
Zillow is an online real estate marketplace that provides a platform for buying, selling, renting, and researching properties. It was founded in 2006 and has become one of the most popular and widely used real estate websites in the United States.

This repository contains the program to scrape and store the data from Zillow's official website specifically at https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_rent/Brooklyn,-New-York,-NY_rb/{}_p/ page where I only take specific data that is the apartments that are rented at Brooklyn, New York. The contents I can scrape from the website are not much due to the strict restriction and minimum data. The item that I scrape at the page is the address of the apartment, the price, and the properties of the apartment.

The reason why I chose the Zillow website is because I am interested in analyzing the price of the apartment that is rented in Brooklyn, New York. By analyzing the price of the apartment I can take some good insights into how the pricing of a rented apartment works. Therefore I can understand more about the impact of properties or others on an apartment price
